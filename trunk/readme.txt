Automatically add affiliate links in your website content so you can make more money. You can specify the keywords and affiliate links you want to be added or you can let the plugin to automatically decide where to add links from available affiliate networks: Amazon, Clickbank, Ebay, Walmart, Shareasale, Commission Junction, Bestbuy or Envato.

== Description ==

Auto Affiliate Links will automatically add affiliate links into your content. You can manually set affiliate links and keywords where they should be added into your content, or you can let the plugin to automatically extract and display links from Amazon, Clickbank, Shareasale, Ebay, Walmart, Commission Junction, BestBuy and Envato Marketplace.

IMPORTANT: Your content won't be modified in any way. The links are added when the content is displayed. 

If you prefer to select your keywords and add your links manually, you can do this from "Auto Affiliate Links" menu in your administration panel. In "General Settings" you can set if you want the links to be cloaked, if you want them to be added on your homepage or not and several other options.

Also, you will have options to make the links nofollow or dofollow, to open in new page or same page and to cloak links. The plugin will give you the most used 100 keywords from your content si you can easily add affiliate links to appear when they are displayed. 

You can limit the number of links that are shown in every article. The frequency range from "Very Low" to "Very High". At Very Low level only 1 link will be displayed in every article. At "Very High" frequency a maximum of 5 links will be added to every article.

If you choose to automatically generate and display links from Amazon, Clickbank or Shareasale you have to first request an API key, and then to activate each module. The links will be added trough javascript so you do not have to worry about nofollowing and search engines.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin will modify the content in the database ? =

No, the plugin only add the links when the page is rendered. The content remain intact in your database.

= Cloaked links are not working, what should I do ? =

Link cloaking can cause problems on some environments ( shared hosting with too much restrictions ). If you experience problems please turn cloaking off.

= Do i have to change my theme to make the plugin work? =

No theme changes are needed for this plugin. 

= How it will affect my design and blog functionality ? =

The blog functionality will not be affected in any way. Links will be added in your content and they will look just like normal links. 

= How do I make links nofollow ? =

On the plugin management page: "Auto Affiliate Links" under "Settings", you will have the option to set a link to have rel="nofollow" attribute.

= How do I make the links to open in new window ? =

On the plugin management page: "Auto Affiliate Links" under "Settings", you will have the option to set the links to open in new or in the same window. By default, links will open in a new window. As a matter of fact, it is better for external links to open in new window, so the user will notice that he is on another website right now, and to have your website still open, if he want to read more or to visit another link.

= Can I add the same affiliate link with more keywords ? =

Yes. You can add more keywords in the same box, sepparated by comma. For example: "android,smartphone,phones". If you add the same link 3 times with different keywords the result will be the same: The link will appear for all the keywords added. 

= Can I add more links for the same keyword ? =

If you add more links with the same keyword, only the first occurence of the keyword will add the first link. If the same keyword appear again in the article, the second link will be added on it.

= How Clickbank links work =

First you have to request an API key from the "API Key" menu. Then, from the "Clickbank Links" menu you will have to enter your affiliate id, category and minimum gravity ( leave 0 for all links ), and set the plugin to "active". Once you do this links from clickbank will start to show on your pages.

= The plugin makes my blog to show odd html code = 

If you encounter any problem with the plugin, please contact us using the form at http://autoaffiliatelinks.com and we will help you to solve your issue. It has been reported that some lightbox plugin my be interfeering with our plugin. 

= Is there a maximum limit on number of manual links I can import? =

There isn't a software limit of how many links you can import. However, you should take into account that uploading a big file at once might cause problems with: maximum file size upload limit on your server ( it is usually 2MB ), and the fact that the script can break or exceed maximum execution time ( 30 seconds ), and only a part of the links will be saved. You should break your uploads into 100-200 links at once.

VERY IMPORTANT. Processing big lists of links ( over 500 ), might cause high server load if you are on a shared hosting, and the page load will be affected. Make sure that you only put the amount of links that you server can handle. With under 500 links you should be safe on every server type.

= My CSV Import file is not working =

Before attempting to import a file, make sure that the csv file is encoded as text file and does not have any custom formatting in it.

Microsoft Excel adds odd formatting to the file and making problems at import and even breaking it. When you save a file in Microsoft Excel, make sure that you check the document type to be txt or csv, to prevent odd formatting, and on that page it should also let you select the separator or delimiter.

If you can't find the options to do this, try LibreOffice, as it is a bit easier to find them there.
